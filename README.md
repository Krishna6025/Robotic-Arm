# Robotic-Arm
5-Degree of motion robotic arm using servo motors and Arduino Uno. It can be used for many purposes in a stationary scene along with having pre-set moments to do any repeated moments
<br/>

This documantation is for a 5DOF Robotic arm that has been made using many online resources.<br />
The essential prerequisets of this project are:
<br/>
1)Arduino Uno with HC-05 bluetooth module<br/>
2)4 10kg MG995 servos along with 1 SG90 servo.<br/>
3)Android app to control the motion of the Arm.<br/>
4)Body for the Arm.<br/><br/>

The Arduino code was written 


The structure of the Arm is 3-D printed with PLA material.
The CAD files for this model was taken from a fellow robotic enthusisat Kelton of 
Build Some Stuff youtube channel. These files are present on https://www.printables.com/model/818975-compact-robot-arm-arduino-3d-printed website for free download. They should also be present in this repo (in case), if not message me for the STL file.
