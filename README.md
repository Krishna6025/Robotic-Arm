# Robotic-Arm
5-Degree of motion robotic arm using servo motors and Arduino Uno.
This documantation is for a 5DOF Robotic arm that has been made using many online resources.<br />
The structure of the Arm is 3-D printed with PLA material. Using few 10kg servos with a servo sheild along with a HC-05 bluetooth module and a functional app created from https://appinventor.mit.edu/ this project can easyly be recreated and modified according to our needs.

The CAD files for this model was taken from a fellow robotic enthusisat Kelton of 
Build Some Stuff youtube channel. These files are present on https://www.printables.com/model/818975-compact-robot-arm-arduino-3d-printed website for free download.
